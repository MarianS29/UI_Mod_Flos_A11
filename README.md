# UI_Mod_Flos_A11
- An editable magisk module for rooted users running Fork LineageOS Custom ROM running Android 11. 
- I've edited many xml files myself taken directly from SystemUI using a template for the module to work.
- This way i can make Android look any way i want. (I edited this mod especially for Quick Settings Panel)
- I also use this mod alongside other substratum themes for better compatibility and cuz i like customizations and to mess with them from time to time
